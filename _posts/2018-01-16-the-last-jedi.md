Here’s where I’m at with *Star Wars: The Last Jedi*, it’s quite possibly the best Star Wars film to date! I have a hard time convincing myself that it isn’t. Thematically, this film is PACKED with all the right stuff that make it intriguing and relevant to our culture today, and I believe into the future as well. It’s also beautifully shot.

Without giving away too much, here are a handful of things *The Last Jedi* is about:

- Failure as the greatest teacher.
- Fighting for love not for hate.
- War not being black and white.
- Understanding the difference between the man and the legend.
- Learning it’s not about who you are or where you come from.

Many people have already written about all the wonderfulness that is *The Last Jedi*. I’ll leave you with one of the best lines from the film:

> That’s how we’re gonna win. Not by fighting what we hate. By saving what we love.
