* Ode to Sacramento / ode to where we came from
* Taking for granted the people, things and places that shape us
* Love and paying attention are the same thing
* Ex boyfriend crying because heâ€™s gay and scared
* Sharing a cupcake with dad
* Mom dropping off child and crying
* Friends enjoying prom just for themselves
* Standing up for what you want: lady bird likes certain music and wants to go to prom
* What if this is the best version of me?
* Church is familiar no matter where you are from
* End frame: lady bird frantically looking around in her new environment
* Father exiting interview that his son is about to also interview for
